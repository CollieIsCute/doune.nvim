# Doune
I want to earn money, but I also want to offer my service (of creating plugins) for free.

My solution: people request plugins they want, I create them, and if they like it then they donate.

## Requesting a plugin / other requests
**Note:** I might not do your request if I think it's to hard. I might even not respond to your request at all. The plugins I create will not be of high quality, and I may not solve a bug which manifests in the plugin. If I can fork an already existing plugin and only edit a few lines to solve the problem, then I'll do so (if the license allows). Presume that the request you send out is paid, even if you already decided to not donate. After done, I do no promises that the plugin will stay the same (have the same name/path/API) (but I will try to keep it the same or very similar).

If you do a request which is not related to creating plugins, then I might fulfill them, or I might not.

Unless you inform me, I will presume that you are using Linux, that you can install binaries and that you know the basics of neovim/lua.

If you want a plugin to be created **OR** a problem you have witch you feel like a plugin may solve (this may include small problems), then create an issue with the following information:
+ The problem you want to solve
+ How much you need this problem to be solved
+ (OPTIONAL) A possible solution
+ (OPTIONAL) A name for the plugin
+ (OPTIONAL) A list of plugins which implement a similar features
+ (OPTIONAL) Other information
